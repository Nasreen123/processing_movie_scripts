You do not come from the forest.
Your hearts beat like... men.
Hagrid has never sent men into our
hollow before.
That's a lie! Hagrid never opend
the Chamber of Secrets!
The monster was born in the
castle. I came from a distant
land, in the pocket of a traveler.
We do not speak of it! It is an
ancient creature we spiders fear
above all others.
I never saw any part of the castle
but the cupboard in which Hagrid
kept me. The girl was discovered
in a bathroom. When I was
accused, Hagrid brought me here.
Go? I think not. My sons and
daughters do not harm Hagrid, on
my command. But I cannot deny
them fresh meat when it wanders so
willingly into our midst.
Goodbye, friend of Hagrid.
