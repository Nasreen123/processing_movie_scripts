Can I have this?
It's not my fault the teachers
have favorites. That Hermione
Granger --
Bet you loved that, didn't you,
Potter? Famous Harry Potter.
Can't even go into a bookshop
without making the front page.
Look, Potter.    You've got yourself
a girlfriend!
That's right. And that's not all
that's new this year...
That's right, Weasley. You see,
unlike some, my father can afford
to buy the best.
No one asked your opinion, you
filthy little Mudblood.
Enemies of the heir, beware!
You'll be next, Mudbloods!
All right there, Scarhead?
Training for the ballet, Potter?
Scared, Potter?
Serpensortia!
Crabbe. Goyle. Where have you
been? Pigging out in the Great
Hall all this time?
And what are you doing down here,
Weasley?
Come on, boys. Weasley thinks
he's going to catch Slytherin's
hair single-handed.
Listen to this...
'Arthur Weasley, Head of the
Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office,
was today fined fifty Galleons for
"bewitching a Muggle car. ""Weasley"
has brought the Ministry into
disrepute,""" said Lucius Malfoy", a
"governor of Hogwarts. ""He is"
clearly unfit to draw up our laws
and his ridiculous Muggle
Protection Act should be scrapped
"immediately.""'"
Arthur Weasley loves Muggle so
much he should snap his wand in
half and go join them. You'd
never know the Weasleys were
purebloods, the way they behave.
Embarrassment to the wizarding
world. All of them.
What's up with you, Crabbe?
Well, go to the hospital wing
and give all those Mudbloods a kick
in the arse for me! You know, I'm
surprised The Daily Prophet hasn't
reported all these attacks yet. I
suppose Dumbledore's trying to hush
it all up. He'll be sacked if it
doesn't stop soon. Father always
said Dumbledore's the worst thing
that's ever happened to this place.
What? Did you say that I was
wrong? You think there's someone
here who's worse than Dumbledore?
Good one, Goyle. You're
absolutely right. Saint Potter.
He's another one with no proper
wizard feeling, or he wouldn't go
around with that Mudblood Granger.
And people actually think he's the
Heir of Slytherin.
You know I haven't, Goyle. How
many times do I have to tell you?
But my father did say this much:
It's been fifty years since the
Chamber was opened. He wouldn't
tell me who opened it -- only that
they were expelled -- but I know
this: the last time the Chamber
of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood
died.
So it's only a matter of time
before one of them's killed this
time. As for me... I hope it's
Granger.
What's the matter with you two?
You're acting very... odd.
Hey!   Where are you going?
