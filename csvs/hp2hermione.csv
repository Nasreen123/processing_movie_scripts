He's,a,"cat,",Ronald!,What,do,you
expect?,It's,in,his,nature.
That's,rich,coming,from,the,owner
of,that,smelly,old,shoe,brush.
It's,all,"right,",Crookshanks.,You
just,ignore,the,mean,little,boy...
You,"know,",the,ancient,Egyptians,of
the,Nile,River,delta,worshipped
the,cat,goddess,Bast.
"Honestly,","Ron,",it's,not,funny.
Harry's,lucky,he,wasn't,expelled.
C'mon.,,,We're,in,here.
Professor,R.J.,Lupin.
It's,on,his,case.
Seems,to,be.,,,Why?,What,is,"it,"
Harry?
But,they'll,catch,"Black,",won't
they?,I,mean...,eventually?
Why're,we,stopping?,We,can't,be
there,yet...
Ouch!,,,,"Ron,",that,was,my,foot!
Harry?,,,,"Harry,",are,you,all,right?
It,was,searching,the,"train,",Harry.
For,Sirius,Black.
I,was,trembling.,Cold.,But
then...,Professor,Lupin,made,it,go
away...
No,one,was,"screaming,",Harry.
Of,course!,That's,why,he,knew,to
give,you,the,"chocolate,",Harry.
What,rubbish.
Ron,spins.,,,,,Frowns,at,Hermione.
Me?,,,I've,been,here,all,along.
Death,omens.,Honestly.,If,you
ask,"me,",Divination's,a,very,wooly
discipline.,Now,Ancient,Runes.
That's,a,fascinating,subject.
A,fair,few.
Don't,be,silly.,How,could,anyone
be,in,two,classes,at,once?
Broaden,your,minds...
Hagrid.,He's,got,to,be,taken,to
a,hospital.,I'll,go,with,"you,"
if,you,like,--
Yes.,But,I,hear,Draco's,father's
furious.,I,don't,think,we've
heard,the,end,of,this...
Achintee?,,,That's,not,far,from
here...
No,one,knows.
Boggarts,are,shape-shifters.
They,take,the,shape,of,whatever
a,particular,person,fears,most.
That's,what,makes,it,so,--
And,the,post,office!,It's,about
200,"owls,",all,sitting,on,color-
coded,"shelves,",depending,on,how
fast,you,want,your,letter,to,go!
"But,",I,"mean,",after,"awhile,",it,got
a,bit,boring.,Don't,you,"think,"
Ron?
"But,","sir,",we've,only,just,begun
learning,about,Red,Caps,and
Hinkypunks.,We're,not,meant,to
start,nocturnal,beasts,for
weeks,--
No!!!
Harry!,,,,How're,you,feeling?
No,one,blames,"you,",Harry.,The
Dementors,aren't,meant,to,come,on
the,grounds.,Dumbledore,was
furious.,After,he,saved,"you,",he
sent,them,straight,off.
It's,meant,to,be,the,most,haunted
building,in,Britain.,Did,I
mention,that?
Should,we,move,a,bit,closer?
Perfect.
Hope,you,don't,mean,yourself.
Harry?
Harry...?
But,Harry,isn't,going,to,keep,it.
He's,going,to,turn,it,over,to
Professor,"McGonagall,",aren't,you?
"Oh,",shut,up.
That's,Madam,Rosmerta.,,,,,Ron
fancies,her.
That's,a,lie!
Harry.,Will,you,explain,to,your
friend,Ronald,that,he,has
absolutely,no,proof,whatsoever
that,my,"sweet,",unassuming,cat,ate
his,"shabby,",decidedly,decrepit
rat.
How'd,it,"go,",Hagrid?
I,meant,the,hearing.
And...?
Hagrid,slings,another,rock,into,water.
You,mustn't,blame,"yourself,"
Hagrid.
Where's,he,"going,",Hagrid?
Here,we,go,again.,It's,the,Grim!
It's,the,Grim!
I,can't,believe,they're,going,to
kill,Buckbeak!,It's,too,horrible.
You...,foul...,loathsome...
evil...,little,cockroach...
That,felt,good.
We'll,stay,with,you,"too,",Hagrid.
I,think,you,owe,someone,an
apology.
I,meant,me.
"Nothing,",I,just,thought,I,saw...
Never,mind.
Ron!,,,No!
Harry.,You,do,realize,what,tree
this,is...
I've,got,you,--
Haaaaaaarrrrrr!!!!!!!!!
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
Thanks.
Where,do,you,suppose,this,goes?
We're,in,the,Shrieking,"Shack,"
aren't,we?
Ron!,,,You're,okay,--
If,you,want,to,kill,"Harry,",you'll
--,you'll...,have,to,kill,"us,",too!
Harry!,,,No!
No!,I,trusted,you!,I,covered,up
for,you.,And,all,this,time,you've
been,his,friend!
He's,a,werewolf!,That's,why,he's
been,missing,classes!
Since,Professor,Snape,set,the
essay.
You,attacked,a,teacher.
Harry.
Don't,worry.,He's,under,the
Somnambulist,Charm.,It's
primarily,used,to,transport,the
seriously,deranged.
Harry...
Professor...?
Harry!
Harry,--
What...?
"Listen,",Harry.,They've,captured
Sirius.,Any,minute,the,Dementors
are,going,to,perform,the,Kiss.
It's,what,Dementors,do,to,those
they,want,to,destroy.,They,clamp
their,jaws,over,the,victim's,mouth
and...,suck,out,his,soul.
No.,It's,worse.,Much,worse.,You
go,on,living.,But,you,have,no
memory.,No,sense,of,self.,You're
just,a,shall.,An,empty,shell...
Headmaster!,You've,got,to,stop
them!,They've,got,the,wrong,man!
The,point,is...,we,know,the,truth.
"Please,","sir,",you,must,believe,us.
"Sorry,",Ron.,But,seeing,as,you
can't,walk...
Seven-thirty.,,,,Where,were,we,at
seven-thirty?
Come,on!,,,We,can't,be,seen!
This,is,a,"Time-Turner,",Harry.
McGonagall,gave,it,to,me,first
term.,This,is,how,I've,been
getting,to,my,lessons,all,year.
Yes.,Dumbledore,wanted,us,to
return,to,this,moment.,Clearly
something,happened,he,wants,us,to
change.
Hurry!,,,Malfoy's,coming!
Of,course!,Remember,what
Dumbledore,said.,If,we,"succeed,"
more,than,one,innocent,life,could
be,spared.
We'll,see.
What?
No!,Fudge,has,to,see,Buckbeak
before,we,steal,him.,"Otherwise,"
he'll,think,Hagrid,set,him,free!
"No,",Harry!,,,You,can't!
Yes!,,You,Must!
"Harry,",you're,in,Hagrid's,hut
right,now.,If,you,go,bursting
"inside,",you'll,think,you've,gone
mad.,Awful,things,can,happen,when
wizards,meddle,with,time.,We
can't,be,seen.
Fudge,is,coming,and...,we're,not
leaving...,why,aren't,we,leaving?
Sorry.
C'mon.,Any,minute,now,we're,going
to,be,coming,out,the,back,door.
Is,that,really,what,my,hair,looks
like,from,the,back?
"Nothing,",I,just,thought,I,saw...
Never,mind.
"Now,",Harry!
"Here,",Beaky...,Come,and,get,the
nice,dead,ferret...,yum,yum...
We,save,Sirius.
No,idea.
Look.,,,It's,Lupin.
Here,comes,Snape.
Now,we,wait.
'Least,someone's,enjoying,himself.
Yes?
With,a,Patronus.,I,heard,Snape
telling,Dumbledore,when,we,were
taken,to,the,hospital.,According
to,"him,",only,a,really,powerful
wizard,could,have,conjured,it.
"But,","Harry,",your,Dad's...
Here,we,come.
Really?
It's,happened.,,Lupin's
transformed.
Saving,your,life.
Why?
Buckbeak.,,,We've,got,to,find,him.
Poor,Professor,Lupin,is,having,a
really,tough,night...
Just,"then,",a,CHILL,WIND,rises...
The,LEAVES,of,the,trees,TREMBLE...
This,is,horrible...
No,one's,"coming,",Harry...
No,one's,coming!,You're,"dying,"
both,of,you...,and,no,one's
coming!
No.
But,I,don't,like,this!
Out,of,the,way!
Alohomora!
Didn't,really,expect,that,to,work.
Dunamis!,Liberare!,Annihilare!
Emancipare!
No.,,,No.,,,No.,,,No.
Quiet!,,,I'm,trying,to,think.
We,have,to,go.
What,d'you,"think,",Harry?,Too,much
for,him,--,everything,that's
happened,tonight?
It's,a,mystery.,Though...,this
fell,out,of,the,wrapping.
