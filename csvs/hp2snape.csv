I've,done,the,"dungeons,"
Headmaster.,No,sign,of,Black.
Nor,anywhere,else,in,the,castle.
Remarkable,"feat,",don't,you,think?
To,enter,Hogwarts,castle,on,one's
"own,",completely,undetected...
You,may,"recall,",prior,to,the,start
of,"term,",I,did,express,my,concerns
when,you,appointed,Professor,--
Turn,to,page,394.
That's,not,really,your,"concern,",is
"it,",Potter?,Suffice,it,to,"say,"
your,Professor,finds,himself
incapable,of,teaching,at,the
present,time.,Page,394.
Quiet!
Now.,Which,of,you,can,tell,me,the
difference,between,an,Animagus,and
a,werewolf?
No,one?,,,How...,disappointing.
"Quiet,",Malfoy!,Though,one,must
admit,to,feeling,your,pain.,That
is,the,second,time,you,have,spoken
out,of,"turn,",Miss,Granger.,Tell
me.,Are,you,incapable,of
restraining,yourself?,Or,do,you
take,pride,in,being,an
insufferable,know-it-all?
Five,points,from,Gryffindor!
As,a,antidote,to,your,"ignorance,",I
prescribe,two,rolls,of,parchment
on,the,werewolf,by,Monday,"morning,"
with,particular,emphasis,placed,on
recognizing,it.
Passing,"notes,",Potter?
Not,exactly,"Picasso,",are,you?,I
hope,you,demonstrate,more,talent
on,the,Quidditch,pitch,this
weekend,then,you,do,as,an,artist.
If,"not,",I,fear,you'll,"perish,"
given,the,weather,forecast.,Until
that,"time,","however,",you'll,forgive
me,if,I,don't,let,you,off
homework.,Should,you,"die,",I
assure,you...,you,need,not,hand,it
in.
Potter.,What're,you,doing
wandering,the,corridors,at,night?
How,extraordinarily,like,your
father,you,"are,",Potter.,"He,","too,"
was,exceedingly,arrogant.
Strutting,about,the,castle,--
Turn,out,your,pockets.
Turn,out,your,pockets!
And,this.,,,What,might,it,be?
Really...
Reveal,your,secret!
Read,it.
Go,on.
Why,you,insolent,little,--
"Well,",well.,Lupin.,Out,for,a,little
walk,in,the,"moonlight,",are,we?
That,remains,to,be,seen.,I've
just,now,confiscated,a,rather
curious,artifact,from,Mr.,Potter.
Take,a,"look,",Lupin.,This,is
supposed,to,be,your,area,of
expertise.
"Clearly,",it's,full,of,Dark,Magic.
Expelliarmus!
"Ah,",vengeance,is,sweet.,How,I
hoped,I'd,be,the,one,to,catch,you.
I,told,Dumbledore,you,were,helping
your,old,friend,into,the,castle.
And,here's,the,proof.
Give,me,a,reason.,I,beg,you.
Listen,to,you,two.,Quarreling
like,an,old,married,couple.,The
creature,and,the,criminal.
Witty,as,ever,I,see.,Tell,"me,"
will,you,be,so,irreverent,when,I
turn,you,over,to,the,Dementors?
Do,I,detect,a,flicker,of,fear?
One,can,only,imagine,what,it,must
be,like,to,endure,the,Dementor's
Kiss.,It's,said,to,be,unbearable
to,witness.,But,I'll,do,my,best.
After,you.
Out,of,the,way!
