HARRY! What d'yer think yer doin'
down 'ere?
Yer a mess! Skulkin' 'round
Knockturn Alley. Dodgy place,
Harry. Don't want no one ter see
yeh down there. People'll be
thinkin' yer up ter no good.
I was lookin' fer a Flesh Eatin'
Slug Repellent. They're ruinin'
the school cabbages.
Ignore 'im, Arthur.
No Malfoy's worth listenin' ter.
Rotten ter the core, the whole
family...
Got jus' the thing. Set 'im down
on that chair o'er there.
Better out than in. Who was he
tryin' ter curse anyway?
He didn'!
Yeh see, Harry. There are some
wizards -- like Malfoy's family --
who think they're better than
everyone else 'cause they're what
people call pureblood.
An' it's codswallop ter boot.
Dirty blood. There's 'ardly a
wizard today that's not half-blood
or less. If we 'adn't married
Muggles we'd've died out long ago.
Besides, they haven't invented a
spell our Hermione can't do...
Don' you think on it, Hermione.
Don' you think on it fer a minute.
Gallopin' Gorgons! Slytherin's
flyin' like they got dragon fire
in their brooms...
Blimey, Harry's got 'imself a
Rogue Bludger!
Look fer yerself! It's bin'
tampered with!
Brok'n?   He doesn't 'ave any bones
at all!
All   righ', Harry?
Second one killed this term.
Reckon it's either foxes or a
Blood-Suckin' Bugbear. Need
Dumbledore's permission ter put a
charm round the hen-coop. Yeh
sure yeh're all righ', Harry? Yeh
look all hot an' bothered.
It wasn't Harry, Professor
Dumbledore!
I was talkin' ter 'im jus' before
that kid was found. It can't've
bin 'im!
I'll swear ter it in front o' the
Ministry o' Magic --
Oh. Right.     I'll wait outside
then.
Mad an' hairy? Wouldn' be talkin'
'bou me, now would yeh?
Flesh-Eatin' Slug Repellent. Fer
the Mandrakes, yeh know.
Accordin' ter Professor Sprout,
they still got a bit o' growin' up
ter do, but once their acne clears
up, we'll be able to chop 'em up,
stew 'em, an' get those people in
the hospital un-Petrified. 'Til
then, you three best watch
yerselves, all righ'?
Who's there?
Nothin', nothin'. I've been
expectin'... Doesn't matter.     Sit
down... I'll make tea...
Oh, yea.   I heard, all righ'.
C-come in.
I never... You know I never,
Professor Dumbledore, sir...
Take me?   Where? Not Azkaban
prison.
What're you doin' here!   Get outta
my house!
An' how many did yeh have ter
threaten before they agreed!
Yeh can take Dumbledore! Take him
away an' the Muggle-borns won'
stand a chance! There'll be
killin's next!
If anyone wanted ter find out some
stuff, all they'd have ter do is
follow the spiders. That'd lead
'em right! Tha's all I'm sayin'.
Sorry I'm late. The owl deliverin'
my release papers got all lost 'n
confused. Some ruddy bird named
Errol.
I jus' want to say... that if it
wasn't fer' you, Harry... you an'
Ron... and Hermione... Well, I
jus' want to say... Thanks.
