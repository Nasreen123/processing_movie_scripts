your,next,interview,I,expect.
You,think,so?
Anything,else?
Fine.
I,reckon,you'd,have,to,be,barking,mad
to,put,your,own,name,in,the,goblet,of
fire.
Wasn't,just,me,who,thought,you'd,done
it.,Everyone,was,saying,it,behind,your
back.

"Well,",us,and,Neville!
Now,I'm,really,depressed.
Well,"Hermione,",you're,a,girl.

to,show,up,alone.,For,a,girl,it's,just
sad.

crying,her,eyes,out.

with,the,enemy.

friendship,on,his,mind.
Hermione,walks,off.
No.
He's,using,you.
Doubt,it.,He's,way,too,old.
Yeah,that,is,what,I,think.
