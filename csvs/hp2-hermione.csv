Harry!
Hello, Hagrid. Oh, it's wonderful
to see you two again.
Oculus Reparo.
Instantly, Harry's glasses are mended.
C'mon.   Everyone's been so worried.
Isn't it thrilling! Gilderoy
Lockhart's going to be there! We
can actually meet him! I mean,
he's written almost the whole
booklist!
Fear of a name only increases fear
of the thing itself.
I should think you'd count
yourself lucky that's all you got.
Mandrake, or Mandragora, is used
to return those who have been
transfigured to their original
state. It's also quite dangerous.
The Mandrake's cry is fatal to
anyone who hears it.
Immobilus!
I'm sure Professor Lockhart just
wanted to give us some hands-on
experience.
Rubbish. Read his books. You'll
see all the amazing things he's
done.
At least no one on the Gryffindor
team had to buy their way in.
They got in on pure talent.
Ron!   Say something!
He called me a Mudblood.
It means dirty blood. Mudblood's
a really foul name for someone who
was Muggle-born. Someone with
non-magic parents. Someone...
like me. It's not a term one
usually hears in civilized
conversation.
Harry!
Voice?   What voice?
'The Chamber of Secrets has been
opened...?'
Look at that. Have you ever seen
spiders act like that? Ron...?
That's why Ron and I went looking
for him, Professor. We'd just
found him when Harry said...
Harry. This voice.     You said you
heard it first in Lockhart's
office?
And did he hear it?
I hardly think someone with
Gilderoy Lockhart's credentials
would lie to one of his students,
Ronald. Besides, if you recall,
we didn't hear anything either.
'Course we do. It's just... it's
a bit weird, isn't it? You hear
this voice and then... Mrs. Norris
turns up Petrified.
No, Harry. Even in the wizarding
world, hearing voices isn't a good
sign.
Professor, I was wondering if you
could tell us about the Chamber of
Secrets?
A HUSH falls over the class.
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
My subject is Transfiguration,
Miss Granger.
Yes, Professor. But there seems
to be very little written about
the Chamber of Secrets. For those
of us with a personal interest in
the subject, that is...
disturbing.
Muggle-borns.
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Yes. Naturally, the school has been
searched many times for such a
chamber. It has never been found.
Professor, what exactly does
legend tell us lies within the
Chamber?
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
The Chamber is said to be home to
something which the heir of Slytherin
alone can control. It is said to be
home... to a monster.
Yes. Couldn't you tell:
McGonagall's worried. All the
teachers are.
The Heir of Slytherin has returned
to Hogwarts. The question is, who
is it?
If you're talking about him --
I heard him. But Malfoy?      The
Heir of Slytherin?
No. Even they aren't that thick.
But there might be another way.
Mind you, it would be difficult.
Not to mention we'd be breaking
about fifty school rules. And it
would be dangerous. Very
dangerous.
Here it is: 'The Polyjuice
Potion. Properly brewed, the
Polyjuice Potion allows the
drinker to transform himself
temporarily into the physical form
of another...'
Yes.
Exactly. But it's tricky. I've
never seen a more complicated
potion. Lacewing flies, leeches,
fluxweed. And, of course, we'll
need a bit of whoever we want to
change into too.
A month.
You didn't have to tell me that.
You're joking, right? Besides,
even with a proper wand, it's too
risky. You could hit Harry.
Finite Incantatem!
You will be able to, won't you?
Again? You mean, the Chamber of
Secrets has been opened before?
Maybe. We'll have to wait for the
Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.
Never.   No one over comes in here.
Moaning Myrtle.
She's a little sensitive.
Do you think he's all right?
You can talk to snakes.
No. They can't. It's not a very
common gift, Harry. This is bad.
I don't know, Harry. But it
sounded like you were egging the
snake on or something. It was...
creepy.
Harry, listen out me. There's a
reason the symbol of Slytherin
house is a serpent. Salazar
Slytherin was a Parselmouth. He
could talk to snakes too.
He lived a thousand years ago.
For all we know... you could be.
Harry!
You don't believe that, Harry, I
know you don't. And if it makes
you feel better, I just heard
Malfoy's staying over for holiday,
too.
Because, in a few days, the
Polyjuice Potion's will be ready.
In a few days... we may truly know
who is the Heir of Slytherin.
Everything's set. We just need a
bit of who you're changing into.
And we also need to make sure that
the real Crabbe and Goyle can't
burst in on us while we're
interrogating Malfoy.
I've got it all worked out. I've
filled these with a simple
Sleeping Draught. Simple, but
powerful.
You know how greedy Crabbe and
Goyle are. They won't leave the
Christmas Feast until every last
drop of trifle is gone.
Now, once they're asleep, hide
them in a broom cupboard and pull
out a few of their hairs.
I've already got mine.
Millicent Bulstrode. She's in
Slytherin. I got this off her
robes.
All right then... I'm going to
check on the Polyjuice Potion.
Remember. Just make sure Crabbe
and Goyle find these.
Hermione exits.     Ron looks at Harry.
Did you get it?
I sneaked those out of the
laundry.
I'm sure I've done everything
right. It looks like the book
said it should. Once we've drunk
it, we'll have exactly one hour
before we change back into
ourselves.
We separate it into three glasses
and add the hairs.
Harry and Ron grimace.
I -- I don't think I'm going.     You
go on without me.
Just go!   You're wasting time!
Go away!
Do you remember me telling you the
Polyjuice Potion was only for
human transformations...?
It was cat hair I plucked off
Millicent Bulstrode's robes! Look
at my face!
Oh, good.   Put those anywhere.
I've got to keep up, haven't I?
Any day now, according to Madam
Pomfrey. I'm just thankful I've
stopped coughing up fur balls.
Now. What about the Chamber of
Secrets? Any new leads?
And has it gotten any better? I
mean... is anyone speaking to you?
Of course not. I don't know how
that got there. Now go. I still
have six hundred pages to read in
Transformation Through the Ages.
Tom Riddle... Hm. And Ron said he
won an award fifty years ago?
Fifty years ago? You're sure?
Don't you remember what Malfoy
told you? The last time the
Chamber of Secrets was opened
was --
Tom Riddle was here, at Hogwarts,
when it happened. What if he
wrote about what he saw? It's
possible he knew where the Chamber
was, how to open it, even what
sort of creature lives in it. If
so, whoever's behind the attacks
this time wouldn't want a diary
like this lying around, would
they?
It might be invisible ink.
Aparecium!
I don't know, Harry. But I think
you should be careful with this.
Something tells me Ron might be
right. It could be dangerous.
I'm scared, Harry. But not of
you.
It can't be Hagrid. It just can't
be.
Look. Hagrid's our friend. Why
don't we just go ask him about it?
It had to be a Gryffindor. Nobody
else knows our password. Unless,
it wasn't a student...
Harry... I think I've just understood
something! I've got to go to the
library!
You solved it! You solved it!
Oh, no!
