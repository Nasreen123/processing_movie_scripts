They are not.
I'm well aware of our bylaws,
Severus, having written more than
a few myself. However, as Head of
Gryffindor House, it is for
Professor McGonagall to determine
the appropriate action.
Splendid. Now, I suggest we
return to the feast. There's a
delicious-looking custard tart I
want to sample.
Argus!
Everyone will proceed to their
dormitories immediately.
Everyone except you three.
She's not dead, Argus. She's been
Petrified.
But how she's been Petrified... I
cannot say.
Innocent until proven guilty.
We will be able to cure her,
Argus. As I understand it, Madam
Sprout has a very healthy growth
of Mandrakes. When they have
matured, a potion will be made
which will revive Mrs. Norris. In
the meantime, I advise caution.
To all.
There's been another attack.
It means our students are in great
danger, Minerva. Mr. Creevey was
fortunate. If not for this...
He would surely be dead.
Tell them the truth. Tell them
Hogwarts is no longer safe. Tell
them it's as we feared. The
Chamber of Secrets is indeed open
again.
About time too. He's been looking
dreadful for days. Pity you had
to see him on a Burning Day. He's
really very handsome most of the
time.
Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry.
Phoenixes burst into flame when it
is time for them to die and are
reborn from the ashes.
Fascinating creatures, phoenixes.
They can carry immensely heavy
loads, their tears have healing
powers, and they make highly
faithful pets.
Hagrid --
Hagrid --
HAGRID! I do not think that Harry
has attacked anyone.
No, Harry. But I must ask you...
is there anything you'd like to
tell me. Anything at all?
It's not wise to be wandering
around this late, Tom.
I'm afraid they are, Tom.
Headmaster Dippet may have no
choice, I'm afraid.
Is there something you wish to
tell me, Tom?
Very well then. Hurry along.
Good evening, Hagrid.
I want it understood, Cornelius,
that Hagrid has my full
confidence.
And what exactly did you want with
me, Lucius?
Calm yourself, Hagrid!
If the governors want my removal,
Lucius, I shall of course step
aside. However... you will find
that I will only truly have left
this school when none here are
loyal to me. You will also find
that help will always be given at
Hogwarts to those who... ask for
it.
Ingenious. Simply... ingenious.
Of course, Tom Riddle was probably
the most brilliant student
Hogwarts has ever seen. I taught
him myself fifty years ago. After
he left, I would occasionally hear
stories of his activities -- dark
rumors -- but after awhile, even
the rumors stopped. When he
finally resurfaced as Lord
Voldemort, most people had
completely forgotten the clever
Head Boy he'd once been.
Wiser wizards than you have been
hoodwinked by Lord Voldemort, Miss
Weasley. No, I think you've
endured enough. I would suggest a
bit of bed rest, however. And
perhaps a large mug of hot
chocolate. I always find that
cheers me up. Minerva, will you
show Arthur and Molly up to the
hospital wing?
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Certainly, Albus.
You two realize, of course, that
in the last few hours, you have
broken perhaps a dozen school
rules?
And that there is sufficient
evidence to expel you both?
Therefore, it seems only
fitting...
That you both receive Special
Awards for Services to the School.
And -- let me see -- yes, I think
two hundred points apiece, which,
I believe, should be more than
enough to secure Gryffindor the
House Cup.
Now, Mr. Weasley, if you would,
have an owl deliver these release
papers to Azkaban. We need our
gamekeeper back.
Ron nods, takes the envelope and exits.
First, Harry, I want to thank you.
You must have shown me real
loyalty down in the Chamber.
Nothing but that could have called
Fawkes to you. Secondly, I sense
you're troubled by something. Am
I right?
You can speak Parseltongue, Harry,
because Lord Voldemort can speak
Parseltongue. Unless I'm much
mistaken, he transformed some of
his own powers to you the night he
gave you that scar.
Not intentionally, but... yes.
It's true, Harry. You do possess
many of the qualities Voldemort
himself prizes. Resourcefulness.
Determination. A certain
disregard for the rules. Yet the
Sorting Hat placed you in
Gryffindor.
Exactly. Which makes you very
different from Voldemort. It's
not our abilities that show what
we truly are, Harry. It's our
choices.
If you want proof that you belong
in Gryffindor, Harry, I suggest
you look more closely at this.
Only a true Gryffindor could have
pulled that out of the Hat.
Yes. When the governors heard
that Arthur Weasley's daughter had
been taken into the Chamber, they
saw fit to summon me back.
Curiously, several of them seemed
under the impression that you
would curse their families if they
didn't agree to suspend me in the
first place, Lucius.
Oh yes. It was Voldemort. Only
this time, he chose to act through
someone else. By means of...
this.
Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter
discovered it.
One only hopes that no more of
Lord Voldemort's old school things
find their way into innocent
hands. The consequences for the
one responsible could be...
severe.
Before we begin our feast, let's
give a round of applause to
Professor Sprout and Madame
Pomfrey, whose Mandrake Juice has
been successfully administered to
all those who had been petrified.
Everyone applauds.
Also, in the wake of recent
events, as a school treat, all
exams have been cancelled.
Everyone cheers, save for Hermione.
