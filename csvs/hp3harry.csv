What,are,you,saying?
Do,you,think,one,of,them,put,my,name
in,the,goblet?
I'm,not,ready,for,this,Sirius.
Someone's,coming!
Who,says,I,was,talking,to,anyone.
Maybe,you're,imagining,"things,",wouldn't
be,the,first,time.
Neville!,You're,doing,it,again!

Dragons.,That's,the,first,task.,They've

better.
Hagrid,warned,me,about,the,dragons.

let,him,forget,this,are,you?
Why,do,they,always,have,to,travel,in
packs?,How,are,you,supposed,to,get,one

last,time,you,held,your,breath,under
the,water,for,an,hour,Hermione?
Neville.,No,"offense,",but,I,really,don't
care,about,plants.,Now,if,there's,a
Tibetan,turnip,that,will,allow,me,to
breathe,underwater,for,an,hour,then
great.
You're,sure,about,this,Neville.
For,an,hour.
Most,likely?
You're,telling,me,this,now?,You,must
