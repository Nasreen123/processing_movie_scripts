I'm Moaning Myrtle. I wouldn't
expect you to know me. Who
would ever talk about fat, ugly,
miserable, moping, moaning
Myrtle?
Ooh, wait till you see. It's
awful!
Come to throw something else at
me?
Don't ask me. Here I am, minding
my own business, and someone
thinks it's funny to throw a book
at me...
Oh sure! Let's all throw books at
Myrtle, because she can't feel it!
Ten points if you can get it
through her stomach. Fifty points
if it goes through her head!
I don't know. I didn't see them.
I was just sitting in the U-bend,
thinking about death and it fell
through the top of my head.
Who's there? Oh...
Hello, Harry. What do you want?
Oooooh, it was dreadful. It
happened right here. In this very
cubicle. I'd hidden because Olive
Hornby was teasing me about my
glasses. I was crying, and then I
heard somebody come in.
I don't know! I was distraught!
But they said something funny. A
kind of made-up language. And I
realized it was a boy speaking.
So I unlocked the door, to tell
him to go away, and... I died.
No idea. I just remember seeing a
pair of great big yellow eyes.
Over there...
Oh, Harry... if you die down
there, you're welcome to share my
toilet.
