Hiya, Harry.
Rescuing you, of course.   Where's
your trunk?
Stand back.
Hold on, Harry!
Put your foot down, Fred!
By the way, Harry.   Happy
Birthday.
It's not much.
They were starving him, Mum!
There were bars on his window!
Ginny. Been talking about you all
summer. Dead annoying, really.
Dad works at the Ministry of
Magic. In the Misuse of Muggle
Artefacts Office.
That's when wizards bewitch
something to drive Muggles mad.
Shrinking door keys, that kind of
thing. Dad loves Muggles. Thinks
they're fascinating.
Harry, sir.   Harry Potter.
Harry's never traveled by Floo
Powder before, Mum.
Mum fancies him.
We better hurry.
I dunno. The gateway's sealed
itself for some reason.
Can't hear a thing.
Harry. If we can't get through,
maybe Mum and Dad can't get back.
The car!
Who says we're driving?
Look, who knows when Mum and Dad
will get back. And we've got to
get to school, haven't we? And
even underage wizards are allowed
to use magic if it's an absolute
emergency. Least that's what Fred
and George always say...
No problem.
There. See. Now I reckon all we
have to do is find the Hogwarts
Express and follow it. Simple.
Right.
Uh oh. The Invisibility Booster
must be faulty.
Any sign of the train?
Brilliant.
It must be around here
someplace.
Take my hand!
Hold on!
Welcome home, Harry.
Well... no. but, until a few
hours ago, I'd never taken off in
one either.
Uh oh.
My wand!    Look at my wand!
What's happening?
What kind of tree is this?
Dad's going to kill me.
Honestly, Professor Snape, I think
it did more damage to us.
We'll go and get our stuff.
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
What are you talking about, Mr.
Weasley?
Well, you're going to expel us,
aren't you?
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Not today, Mr. Weasley. But I
must impress upon both of you the
seriousness of what you have done.
I will be sending owls to both of
your families tonight. And you
will each get a detention.
I should think you'd mind your own
business.
Say it.   I'm doomed.
Imagine that.
Bloody bird's a menace -- Oh...
no.
Look at these questions.   They're
all about him.
'What is Gilderoy Lockhart's
greatest achievement to date?'
What do we do now?
Can you believe him?
He says he's done.
Uh-oh.   I smell trouble.
Those are Nimbus Two Thousand
Ones.
You'll pay for that one, Malfoy!
Eat slugs!
It's disgusting!
Hear what?
Harry, what are you doing?
What's that?   Hanging underneath?
I... don't... like... spiders.
A Squib's someone who's born into
a wizarding family but hasn't got
any powers of their own. It's why
Filch is trying to learn magic
from a Kwikspell course. It's
also why he hates students so
much. He's bitter.
Maybe he was lying.
Are you mad!
Three glasses who?
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Salazar Slytherin wished to be
more selective about the students
admitted to Hogwarts. He believed
that magical learning should be
kept within all-magic families.
In other words, purebloods.
Unable to sway the others, he
decided to leave the school.
According to legend, Slytherin had
built a hidden chamber in this
castle, known as the Chamber of
Secrets. Shortly before
departing, he sealed it until that
time when his own true heir
returned to the school. The heir
alone would be able to open the
Chamber of Secrets and unleash the
horror within, and by so doing,
purge the school of all those who,
in Slytherin's view, were unworthy
to study magic.
D'you think it's true? D'you
think there really is a Chamber of
Secrets?
Let's think. Who do we know who
thinks Muggle-borns are scum.
Of course! You heard him:
'You'll be next, Mudbloods'!
Crabbe and Goyle must know.     Maybe
we could trick them into
telling...
When do we start?
You mean, Harry and I drink some
of this stuff and we turn into
Crabbe and Goyle?
Wicked!   Malfoy'll tell us anything!
Hang on now. I'm drinking nothing
with Crabbe's toenails in it.
Rogue Bludger?
Of course! Don't you see? Lucius
Malfoy must've opened it when he
was at school here, and now he's
told Draco how to do it.
Enlighten me. Why are we
brewing this potion in broad
daylight, in the middle of a
girls' lavatory? Don't you think
we'll get caught?
Why?
Who's Moaning Myrtle?
What's the fun in that?
Come on. Move. Now.
You're a Parselmouth!    Why didn't
you tell us?
Oh, that's what you said to it.
I heard you speaking Parseltongue.
Snake language.
Exactly. And now the whole
school's going to think you're his
great-great-great grandson or
something.
Oh, c'mon, Harry.     Fred's just
having a laugh.
Okay, so half the school thinks
you're nipping off to the Chamber
of Secrets every night. Who
cares?
Why would that make anyone feel
better?
How?
And whose hair are you ripping out?
Have you ever heard of a plan
where so many things could go
wrong?
Now what?
Ugh.   Essence of Crabbe...
Think I'm gonna be sick...
Harry?
Bloody hell.
Bloody hell.
Bloody hell.
Bloody hell.
Hey... Where's Hermione?
Don't swing your arms like that.
Crabbe holds them sort of stiff.
"Harry goes a bit more ""Neanderthal."""
Yeah.   That's better.
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
Stomachache.
Ho!
That was close!
Look at your tail.
Madam Pince asked that we relay a
message to you, Hermione: She'd
appreciate it if you'd leave a few
books for the rest of the school.
Is that thing ever going away?
We all are, believe me.
'To Miss Granger. Wishing you a
speedy recovery, from your
concerned teacher Gilderoy
Lockhart.' You sleep with this
under your pillow?
I know Hermione's mental, but can
you believe she falls for that
smarmy nonsense of Lockhart's?
Yuck.
But it can't hurt if someone
throws something at you. I mean,
it'd just go right through you,
wouldn't it?
Fifty points if you can get it
through her nose.
It's a diary, it's old... and was
most recently in a toilet, Harry.
Are you mad? That could be
cursed. Dad once told me about a
book the Ministry confiscated that
burned the eyes out of anyone who
tried to read it.
Who doesn't?
Tin Marvolo Riddle? Hang on. I
know that name...
Of course! The night I had
detention... My job was to polish
the silver in the trophy room. I
remember because I kept burping
slugs all over Tom Riddle's
trophy. I must have wiped slime
off his name for an hour.
What?    What's happened...?
We don't even know this Riddle.
He sounds like a dirty, rotten
snitch to me.
That'd be a cheerful visit.
Hullo, Hagrid. Tell us, have you
been setting anything mad and
hairy loose in the castle lately?
Well, whoever it was, they were
looking for something.
Hey, Ginny!   Going to the match?
I tell you, she gets weirder and
weirder by the day...
Kill this time... Let me rip...
Tear.
No... don't tell me...
That's Hermione. When in doubt,
go to the library
Hermione!
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
She was found near the library.
Along with this. Does it mean
anything to either of you?
But you heard McGonagall. We're
not allowed to leave the tower
except for class --
That's Dad's boss! Cornelius
Fudge. The Minister of Magic!
Harry elbows Ron to shut him up.
Hagrid's right. With Dumbledore
gone, there'll be an attack a day.
What are you doing?
They're heading into the Dark
Forest.
Why spiders. Why couldn't it be
'Follow the butterflies'?
Harry!... Harry, it's our car!
I don't have a good feeling about
this, Harry --
Harry...
Can we panic now?
Nice knowing you.
Thanks for that.
Flying gear's jammed!
'Follow the spiders'! Follow the
spiders'! If he ever gets out of
Azkaban, I'll kill Hagrid. I
mean, what was the point of
sending us in there? What have we
found out?
We know that, Madam Pomfrey. It's
just, well, you see, we thought,
maybe, we could... be with her for
a bit. She's our... friend, you
see, and... even if she can't hear
us... I mean, it can't hurt, can
it?
You don't think Lockhart could be
the heir of Slytherin, do you?
Right. Forget I said it.
But it kills by looking people in
the eye. Why is it no one's dead?
And Mrs. Norris? I'm pretty sure
she didn't have a camera or a
mirror, Harry.
But how's the Basilisk been
getting around? A dirty great
snake. Someone would have seen...
Pipes...? It's using the
plumbing.
Moaning Myrtle!
She knew something, Harry. She'd
found out something about the
Chamber of Secrets. That's why
she was taken. I mean, she was --
is -- a pure-blood. There can't
be any other reason.
Harry. D'you think there's any
chance at all she's not, you
know --
What about my sister?
You're the Defense Against the
Dark Arts teacher! You can't go
now!
Is there anything you can do?
Say something, Harry. Say
something in Parseltongue.
English.
A bloody lot of good if it's a
two-hundred-foot drop onto jagged
rocks.
What's that?   Up ahead?
Bloody hell. Whatever shed this
must be twenty feet long. Or
more.
Heart of a lion, this one.
I'm okay. This git's not, though.
He got blasted by my wand.
What now?
I'll try and shift some of this
rock. So you can get back
through. And, Harry --
Ginny!
You're alive.    I can't believe it.
Remind you of anyone?
His Memory Charm backfired.
Hasn't got a clue who he is. I
keep having to stop him wandering
off. He's a danger to himself.
No.
What's with the bird?
Welcome back, Hermione.
