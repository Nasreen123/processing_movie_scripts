Welcome!,Welcome,to,another,year
at,Hogwarts!,I,have,a,few,things
to,"say,",before,we,become,befuddled
by,our,excellent,feast.,I,myself
am,particularly,looking,forward,to
the,flaming,kiwi,"cups,","which,"
while,somewhat,treacherous,for
those,of,us,with,facial,hair...
McGONAGALL,clears,her,throat.
Mm.,Yes.,"First,",I'm,pleased,to
welcome,Professor,R.J.,"Lupin,",who
has,kindly,consented,to,fill,the
post,of,Defense,Against,the,Dark
Arts.,Good,luck,to,"you,"
Professor.
As,some,of,you,may,"know,",Professor
"Kettleburn,",our,Care,of,Magical
Creatures,teacher,for,many,"years,"
has,decided,to,retire,in,order,to
spend,more,time,with,his,remaining
limbs.,"Fortunately,",I'm,delighted
to,announce,that,his,place,will,be
filled,by,none,other,than,our,own
Rubeus,Hagrid!
"Finally,",on,a,more,disquieting
"note,",Hogwarts,--,at,the,request
of,the,Ministry,of,Magic,--,"will,"
until,further,"notice,",play,host,to
the,Dementors,of,Azkaban.
The,Dementors,will,be,stationed,at
the,entrances,to,the,grounds.,While
they,are,under,strict,orders,not,to
enter,the,castle,"itself,",you,will,on
occasion,see,them,as,you,go,about
your,daily,activities.,Under,no
circumstances,are,you,to,approach
them.,It,is,not,in,the,nature,of
a,Dementor,to,be,forgiving.
Mr.,Filch.,Round,up,the,ghosts.
Tell,them,to,search,every,painting
in,the,castle,for,the,Fat,Lady.
Dear,lady.,Who,did,this,to,you?
Secure,the,"castle,",Mr.,Filch.,The
rest,of,you...,to,the,Great,Hall.
I,didn't,really,expect,him,to
linger.
I,do,not,believe,a,single
professor,inside,this,castle
would,have,helped,Sirius
Black,enter,"it,",Severus.
No...,I,feel,quite,confident,the
castle,is,safe.,And,I'm,more,than
willing,to,let,the,students,return
to,their,Houses.,But,tomorrow.
For,"now,",let,them,sleep...
It's,astonishing,what,the,body,can
endure,when,the,mind,allows,itself
to,rest.
Sir,Cadogan.,Is,it,possible,that
you,let,a,mysterious,man,enter
Gryffindor,Tower,tonight?
Scabbers...?
I,"do,",Miss,Granger.,But,I'm,sorry
to,say,the,word,of,three,thirteen-
year-old,wizards,will,convince,few
others.,A,child's,"voice,",however
honest,and,"true,",is,meaningless,to
those,who,have,forgotten,how,to
listen.
Ah...,a,shooting,star.,If,ever
one,was,to,make,a,"wish,",now,would
be,the,time.,But,"time,",I'm
"afraid,",is,precisely,our
problem...
Mysterious,"thing,",time.,Powerful.
"And,",when,meddled,with...
dangerous.,Sirius,Black,is,in,the
topmost,cell,of,the,Dark,Tower.
You,know,the,"laws,",Miss,Granger.
You,must,not,be,seen.,And,you
"would,",I,"feel,",do,well,to,return
before,this,last,chime.,If,not...
"well,",the,consequences,are,really
too,ghastly,to,discuss.,Three
turns,should,do,"it,",I,think.,If
you,"succeed,",more,than,one
innocent,life,may,be,spared
tonight.
By,the,"way,",when,in,"doubt,",I,find
retracing,my,steps,to,be,a,wise
place,to,begin...,Good,luck.
Excuse,"me,",Minister.,I,believe,I
must,sign,as,well...
Professor,Dippet,had,those
blackberries,planted,when,he,was
Headmaster...
How,extraordinary!
I'm,quite,sure,the,Minister,isn't
suggesting,that,you,had,anything
to,do,with,"it,",Hagrid.,How,could
you?,You've,been,with,us,all
along.
Search,the,skies,if,you,"must,"
Minister.,In,the,"meantime,",I
wouldn't,say,no,to,a,cup,of,"tea,"
Hagrid.,Or...,a,large,brandy.
It,seems,your,services,will,no
longer,be,required.
By,the,"way,",when,in,"doubt,",I
always,find,retracing,my,steps,to
be,a,wise,place,to,begin...,Good
luck.
Well?
Did,what?
