I can't, Hedwig. I'm not allowed
to use magic outside of school.
Besides, if Uncle Vernon --
Now you've done it.
She's bored. If I could just let
her out for an hour or two --
But I haven't gotten any messages.
From any of my friends. Not one.
All summer.
I'll be in my bedroom, making no
noise and pretending I don't
exist.
What... Who are you?
I see. Not to be rude or
anything, but this isn't a great
time for me to have a house-elf in
my bedroom.
Why don't you sit down?
Shhhh! I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to offend you or anything --
You can't have met many decent
wizards then.
Are you... all right?
Your... family?
Not go back?   But... I have to.
What terrible things?    Who's
plotting them?
Okay! I understand.     You can't
say --
Stop!   Stop!
See why I've got to go back? I
don't belong here. I belong in
your world -- at Hogwarts. It's
the only place I've got...
friends.
Well, I expect they've been --
hang on, how do you know my
friends haven't been writing me?
Give me those. Now.
Dobby... Please... No...
I can't.   Hogwarts is my home.
'Dear Mr. Potter. We have
received intelligence that a Hover
Charm was used at your place of
residence at twelve minutes past
seven this evening. As you know,
underage wizards...'
Well done, Dudley. Finally
learned the days of the week, have
you.
It's no good turning your beak up.
It's all we've got.
Ron?
Fred?   George? What're you doing
here?
Hedwig!
I think it's... brilliant!
Raids?
The Misuse of Muggle Artefacts...?
Floo Powder?
D-Dia-gon Alley!
I'm fine, thanks. I'm just --
Hagrid!
I was lost, I -- Hang on. What
were you doing down there?
I need to remember that one.
Who?
Thank you.
You have these. I'll buy my
own --
He was a murderer.
His name is Voldemort.
Sorry. Lost control of the
trolley.
Why can't we get through?
The train leaves at exactly eleven
o'clock. We've missed it.
Maybe we should go wait by the
car.
This is mad.   We can't drive to
Hogwarts.
You don't mean -- Ron, no.
Something tells me we're going to
regret this.
No offense, Ron, but are you sure
you know how to fly this.
Uh, Ron. I should tell you.    Most
Muggles aren't accustomed to
seeing a flying car.
There!   Up ahead! Look...
Do you hear that?
I'm trying!   Your hand's all
sweaty!
I think we found the train.
Just out of interest, Ron. Have
you ever landed a car before?
Be thankful it's not your neck.
Reverse!   Reverse!
A house elf shows up in my
bedroom, we can't get through the
barrier to Platform Nine and Three
Quarters, we almost get killed by
a tree... clearly someone doesn't
want me here this year.
Professor Dumbledore.    Professor
McGonagall...
Mr. Filch.   You dropped this...
You're doomed.
Hello, Colin.    Nice to meet --
Look at it this way. How much
worse can things get?
'What is Gilderoy Lockhart's
favorite color?'
'When is Gilderoy Lockhart's
birthday and what would his ideal
gift be?'
Hands on? Hermione, he didn't
have a clue what he was doing.
Draco?
Get out of the way, Colin!
Let's take him to Hagrid. He'll
know what to do.
Malfoy. He called Hermione, well,
I don't know exactly what it
means...
That's horrible.
What?
No... not you, that... voice.
That... voice. Didn't you hear
it?
Spooky.
Did you hear it?
That... voice.
I heard it first in Lockhart's
office and then again, just --
Kill... Time to kill...
It's moving.   I think it's going
to... kill.
That's Filch's cat.   Mrs. Norris.
It's not true, sir! I swear! I
never touched Mrs. Norris -- And I
don't even know what a Squib is.
When I said I wasn't hungry. We
were heading back to the Common
Room and... found Mrs. Norris.
Yes.
He said he didn't.
You do believe me, don't you?
I can't explain it -- it was...
scary.
D'you think I should've told them
-- Dumbledore and the others, I mean.
But if there really is a Chamber
of Secrets, and it's really been
opened, that means...
Maybe Ron's right, Hermione. I
mean, look at his family. The
whole lot of them have been in
Slytherin for centuries.
How long will it take to make?
A month? But if Malfoy is the
heir of Slytherin... he could
attack half the Muggle-borns in
the school by then.
No... no... not you.
Dobby!
It was you! You stopped the
barrier from letting Ron and me
through!
You nearly got Ron and me
expelled!
Your Bludger? You made that
Bludger chase after me?
You'd better clear off before my
bones come back, Dobby, or I might
strangle you!
I don't suppose you could tell me
why you're trying to kill me?
Why do you wear that thing, Dobby?
Repeat itself? You mean, this has
happened before?
Tell me, Dobby? When did this
happen before? Who's doing it
now?
Who is it?
No, Dobby!   Tell me!
Nice to meet you. I'm --
I wouldn't bet on that.
You wish.
Rictusempra!
Leave him!
I'm a what?
I know. I mean, I accidentally
set a python on my cousin Dudley
at the zoo once. But so what? I
bet loads of people here can do
it.
What's bad? If I hadn't told that
snake not to attack Justin --
You were there! You heard me!
I spoke a different language? But
I didn't realize -- how can I
speak a language without knowing I
can?
But I'm not.   I... can't be.
Who am I, Hedwig? What am I?
Hagrid... what're you doing
here?
It's nothing. I'd better get
going. I've got a lot of
studying...
Professor, I swear I didn't --
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
This is out of my hands, Potter.
Mr. Filch, will you take care of
this, please?
Well, you see, I was wondering...
You're wrong!
Professor, your bird... I couldn't
do anything... He just caught
fire.
You don't think it was me,
Professor?
No, Professor. Nothing.
He's the only one.
Maybe they're right.
I didn't know I could speak
Parseltongue. What else don't I
know about myself? Maybe you can
do something... even something
horrible... and not know you did
it.
Crabbe and Goyle.
Ron?
We still sound like ourselves.
You need to sound more like
Crabbe.
Lower.
Less intelligent.
Excellent.
Hermione, are you okay?
You're wrong!
Harry Potter.
Then you must have some idea who's
behind it all?
Hermione, come out.   We've got
loads to tell you!
Nothing.
Neville asked to borrow a tubeworm
in Potions yesterday. I suppose
that's something.
Looks like Myrtle's flooded the
bathroom.
Why would I throw something at
you?
Who threw it at you anyway?
This is a diary. And it's old...
I'll take my chances...
Ahhh! MY EYES! MY EYES!
Ginny! I was only joking --
Brilliant. Even your sister
thinks I'm the monster now.
That's odd.    He never wrote in it.
Special Services to the School or
something --
Yes.   Why?
Fifty years ago! That means --
That's a brilliant theory,
Hermione. With just one tiny
little flaw. There's nothing
written in this diary.
You don't think I'm dangerous, do
you, Hermione? I mean, you're not
scared. Of me.
Do... you... know... anything...
about... the... Chamber... of...
Secrets?
Yes.
Can... you... tell... me?
No.
Excuse me. Could you tell me
where I am? Hello...?
Ron!
Ron!
It was Hagrid. Hagrid opened the
Chamber of Secrets fifty years ago.
The monster had killed someone,
Ron. What would any of us done?
What's that you've got, Hagrid?
And they found it... Tom Riddle's
diary is gone.
What do you understand!
The library?
We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron.
I can't believe it's him. But if
he did set the monster loose last
time -- even by accident -- he'll
know how to get inside the Chamber
of Secrets. And that's a start.
I think it's time to get my Dad's
old Cloak out again.
What's that for?
Are you okay? Hagrid?      Did you
hear about Hermione?
Look... we have to ask you
something. Do you know who's
opened the Chamber of Secrets?
Look...
C'mon.
You heard Hagrid. Follow the
spiders.
There's something moving over
there... something big.
It's been here all the time! Look
at it. The Forest has turned it
wild.
C'mon, we don't want to lose the
trail.
Don't panic.
Yes. We're friends of Hagrid's.
And you... you're...
... Aragog, aren't you?
He's in trouble. Up at school,
there've been attacks. They think
it's Hagrid. They think he's
opened the Chamber of Secrets.
Like before.
But if Hagrid never... that
means... you're not the monster.
Shhh!
But if you're not the monster,
what did kill that girl fifty
years ago?
But have you seen it?
What!
Well... thank you. We'll just
go...
Let's go!
Don't mention it.
That way! It's the only way out!
Hurry! They're catching up!
Can you get us in the air?
We know one thing. Hagrid never
opened the Chamber of Secrets. He
was innocent.
Wish you were here, Hermione. We
need you. Now more than ever...
'Of the many fearsome beasts that
roam our land, none is more deadly
than the Basilisk. Capable of
living for hundreds of years,
instant death awaits any who meet
this giant serpent's eye. Spiders
flee before it and only the
crowing of the rooster can kill
it.'
Ron! This is it! The monster in
the Chamber of Secrets is a
Basilisk. That's why I can hear
it speak. It's a snake.
Because no one did look it in the
eye. Not directly at least...
Colin saw it through his camera.
Justin -- Justin must've seen the
Basilisk through Nearly Headless
Nick! Nick got the full blast of
it, but he's a ghost -- he
couldn't die again...
... And Hermione... had the
mirror! I bet you anything she
was using it to look round
corners, in case it came along.
The water... there was water on
the floor that night. She only
saw the Basilisk's reflection...
The crowing of the rooster is
fatal to it! That's why Hagrid's
roosters were killed! Spiders
flee before it! It all fits!
Hermione answered that too.
Remember what Aragog said? About
that girl fifty years ago? She
died in a bathroom. What if she
never left.
C'mon. Let's go see Lockhart. He
may be a brainless git, but he's
going to try and get into the
Chamber. We can tell him what we
know...
We'll find her, Ron.   Ginny's
going to be fine.
Professor, we've got some
information for you --
Are you going somewhere?
You're running away? After all
that stuff you did in your books?
You wrote them!
You're a fraud! You've just been
taking credit for what a load of
other wizards have done!
Expelliarmus!
Looks like those Dueling Lessons
came in handy after all,
Professor.
To ask you how you died.
Who was it, Myrtle?
Just like that? How?
This is it, Ron. This is the
entrance to the Chamber of
Secrets.
Open up.
Oh, yes there is. You first.
All right.   Let's go.
Thanks, Myrtle.
Lumos!
Remember. Any sign of movement,
close your eyes straight away.
Maybe it's asleep.
Ron?   Are you okay?
Wait here. I'll go on. I'll go
on and... find Ginny. If I'm not
back in an hour...
He leaves it there.
See you in a bit.
Open.
Ginny!   Please don't be dead.
Wake up! Wake up!
Ginny!
Tom... Tom Riddle? What d'you
mean, she won't wake? She's
not...
Are you a ghost?
She's cold as ice. You've got
to help me, Tom. There's a
basilisk --
Give me my wand, Tom.
Listen, we've got to go!   We've
got to save her!
But she's dying!
No... she couldn't -- she
wouldn't.
But... Why?...
And why did you want to meet me?
Hagrid's my friend. And you
framed him, didn't you?
I'll bet Dumbledore saw right
through you.
Well, you haven't finished it this
time. In a few hours Mandrake
Draught will be ready and everyone
who was petrified will be all
right again.
Ginny stole the diary from my
room? But why?
Like what?
Why do you care how I escaped?
Voldemort was after your time.
You. You're the heir of
Slytherin. You're Voldemort?
Albus Dumbledore is the greatest
sorcerer in the world!
He'll never be gone! Not as long
as those who remain are loyal to
him!
Fawkes.
Don't look. Don't look into its
eyes.
Ginny. You need to get yourself
out... Follow the chamber...
You'll find Ron...
You were brilliant, Fawkes. I
just... wasn't quick enough.
Of course. Dumbledore told me.
Phoenix tears have healing powers.
It's all right, Ginny. It's over.
It's just a memory...
Where's Lockhart?
I think... I think he's telling me
he can take us out of here.
It's just, you see, sir, I
couldn't help noticing certain
things. Certain similarities.
Between Tom Riddle and me.
Voldemort put a bit of himself in
me?
So the Sorting Hat was right.    I
should be a Slytherin.
Only because I asked it to.
'Godric Gryffindor.'
Dobby! This is your Master? The
family you serve is the Malfoys!
Sir? I wonder if I could have
that.
Mr. Malfoy!    I have something of
yours.
I think you do, sir. I think you
slipped it into Ginny Weasley's
cauldron that day in Diagon Alley.
Just promise me something.
Never try to save my life again.
With loads of help from you.
There's no Hogwarts without you,
Hagrid.
