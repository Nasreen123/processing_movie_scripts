"Listen,",you,stupid,prat,--
Excuse,me?
Brilliant...,Professor.
At,least,Hagrid,didn't,get,sacked.
"Yes,","Professor,",but,I,thought,if
you,said,I,could,go,--
PROFESSOR,McGONAGALL
But,I,don't,say,so.,A,parent,or
guardian,must,"sign,",and,since,I,am
"neither,",it,would,be
inappropriate.
I'm,"sorry,",Potter.,But,that's,my
final,word.
Really?
Not,to,mention,The,Shrieking
"Shack,","which,",according,to
"Hermione,",is,the,most,severely
haunted,building,in,Britain.
"Professor,",can,I,ask,you
something?
I,did,think,of,Voldemort,first.
But,"then,",I,remembered,that,night
on,the,train...,and,the
Dementors...
Before,I,fainted...,I,heard
something.,A,woman.,Screaming.
I,think,it,was,my,mother.,,,The
night,she,was,murdered.
Sirius,Black's,trying,to,kill,me.
I'm,glad,you,had,a,good,time.
Really.,And,thanks,for,this.
Rubbish,or,"not,",you're,right.,It
can't,hurt.
Excuse,"me,","sir,",but...,where's
Professor,Lupin?
Faster!
Come,on!
Probably,a,right,sight,better,than
he,normally,does.
Brilliant.
What,happened?
Really?,,,,I,meant,the,match.,,,Who
won?
Silence.,,,,,Uncomfortable,glances.
Why,do,they,affect,me,"so,"
Professor?,I,"mean,",more,than
everyone,else...
I'm,"scared,",Professor.
I,need,to,learn,how,to,fight,them.
You,could,teach,"me,",Professor.
You,made,that,Dementor,on,the
train,go,away...
But,you,made,it,go,away.
What's,this,rubbish?
'Messrs,"Moony,","Wormtail,",Padfoot
and,Prongs,are,proud,to,present

He,was,their,friend.,And,he
betrayed,them.,He,was,their
friend.
I,hope,he,finds,me.,But,when,he
"does,",I'm,going,to,be,ready.,When
he,"does,",I'm,going,to,kill,him.
If,Black,can,fight,the,"Dementors,"
I,need,to,know,how,too.
Expecto,Patronum...
Expecto...,Patronum...
Expecto...,Expecto...
That's,one,nasty,Dementor.
The,first,time,I,rode,a,broom.
There's,another.,It's,not,happy
exactly.,I,"mean,",it,is.,It's,the
happiest,I've,ever,felt.,But
it's...,complicated.
Just,do,it!
Expecto,Patronum!
I,think,I've,had,enough.,,,,For
today.
I,was,thinking,of,him.,And,Mum.
Seeing,their,faces.,They're,just
talking,to,me.,Just...,talking.
That,was,the,memory,I,chose.,I
don't,even,know,if,it's,real...
Harry,grips,the,"door,",pushes,past.
But,it's,the,best,I,have.
Everybody,out!
Show,yourself.
Ron!
Ron!
I,could've,killed,him.
"No,",I,won't.,Know,why?,Because,I
don't,care,about,your,stupid,rat!
I,don't,care,about,your,stupid
cat!,I've,got,few,other,things,on
my,mind,right,now!
I,solemnly,swear,that,I,am,up,to
no,good.
Mischief,managed!
I,was...,I,was...,sleepwalking...
My,dad,didn't,strut.,Nor,do,I.
"Now,",if,you,don't,"mind,",I'd
appreciate,you,lowering,your,wand.
Spare,bit,of,parchment...

abnormally,large,nose,out,of,other
people's,business.'
Professor.,Just,so,you,"know,",I
don't,think,the,map,always,works.
"Earlier,",it,showed,someone,in,the
castle.,Someone,I,know,to,be,dead.
Peter,Pettigrew.
Professor,Trelawney,--
S-sorry?
No.,,,Nothing.
It,just,got,worse.
She,and,Ron,look,and,SEE:
I,say,we,set,him,free.
Ow!
Harry,"turns,",looks,out,the,window.
Hagrid...
C'mon.

That's,not,good.
Ron!,Run!
Ron,spins.,,,,,Looks,toward,Harry.
Hold,"on,",Ron!
"No,",Ron...

Then,it'll,be,you!
Yes.
No!
You,betrayed,my,parents!,,,You,sold
them,to,Voldemort!
Did,he,listen!,When,my,mother,was
dying!,Did,he,hear,her,screaming!
What're,you,talking,about?
There's,nobody,here.
Expelliarmus!
You,said,Peter,before.,,,,Peter,who?
He,killed
No.,Pettigrew's,dead.
him.
The,Map,was,lying,then,--
All,they,could,find,of,Pettigrew
was,his,--
Show,me.
No.
I,know,what,he,is.,But,we'll,take
him,to,the,castle.
Get,off!,I,said,we'd,take,you,to
the,castle.,After,"that,",the
Dementors,can,have,you.
I,don't,reckon,my,father'd,want
his,best,friends,to,become,killers
for,a,worthless,piece,of,vermin
like,Pettigrew.,Besides:,"Dead,"
the,truth,dies,with,him.,Alive...
you're,free.
I,know.
When!
Come,live,with,you?
No!
Expelliarmus!
Sirius!
"Please,",Professor.,Stop...,It's
me.
Suddenly...,a,HOWL,pierces,the,night.
Sirius!
Harry,looks,into,his,glassy,eyes.
Sirius!
No...,No!
Expecto...,Patronum!
Expecto...,Patronum...
I,saw,my,dad.
He,sent,the,Dementors,away...,I
saw,him.,Across,the,lake...
The,Kiss...?
You,"mean,",they're,going,to,kill
Sirius?
It's,"true,",sir.,Sirius,is
innocent,--
What,just,happened?,,,,Where's,Ron?
Huh?,,,Dunno...,going,to,Hagrid's?
Hermione!,Will,you,please,tell,me
what,it,is,we're,doing?!
But,that...,that's...,us.,,,,,,This,is
not...,normal.
You,"mean,",we've,gone,back,in,time?
Good,punch.
Look.,,,,Buckbeak's,still,alive.
Buckbeak?,But...,how,will,saving
Buckbeak,help,Sirius?
Nothing.
Here,they,come.,I,better,hurry.
That's,Pettigrew,--
"Hermione,",that's,the,man,who
betrayed,my,parents!,You,don't
expect,me,to,just,sit,here...
Are,you,mad?
That,hurt.
Shhh!
Get,away!
"C'mon,",Buckbeak.,Come,on...
Buckbeak,refuses,to,move.
Now,what?
And,we,do,that...,how?
Wait,until,Fred,and,George,hear
about,that,one.
And,now,we,wait.
Hermione...
Before.,Down,by,the,lake.,When,I
was,with,Sirius...,I,did,see
someone...,that,someone,made,the
Dementors,go,away...
It,was,my,Dad.
Hermione,looks,at,Harry.
It,was,my,Dad,who,conjured,the
Patronus.
Dead.,I,know.,I'm,just,telling
you,what,I,saw.
You,see,Sirius,talking,to,me?
He's,asking,me,to,come,live,with
him.
When,we,free,"him,",I'll,never,have
to,go,back,to,the,Dursley's.,I'm
going,to,tell,him,I'd,like,to,live
someplace,in,the,country.,I,think
he'd,like,"that,",after,all,those
years,in,Azkaban.,We,don't,need,a
big,place,and,I,can,help,him...
Which,means,Pettigrew,is,slipping
safely,into,the,night.,While,we
just,stand,here...
What,are,you,doing?
Thanks.,,,But,we,have,to,move.
Because,that,werewolf,you,just
called,is,running,right,this,way.
They,exchange,a,glance,and...,RUN.
Let's,go.
Don't,worry.,My,Dad,will,come...
Right,there...,you'll,see...,he'll
come...,any,minute...,he'll
conjure,the,Patronus
HE,WILL!,,,He,will,come!
You,were,"right,",Hermione.,It
wasn't,my,dad,I,saw,earlier.,It
was...,me.,I,saw,myself,conjuring
the,Patronus,before.,I,knew,I
could,do,it,this,"time,",because...
because,I'd,already,done,it.,Does
that,make,sense?
Hermione,contemplates,this.
I,want,to,go,with,you.
Anything.
He's,free,--,Sirius.,,,We...,we,did
it.
Afraid,so.,Always,been,a,bit,of
the,nervous,"type,",Ron,has.
You've,been,sacked.
Resigned!,,,But,why!
Snape.
But,Dumbledore,--
Well.,At,first,I,thought,it,was,a
"horse,",or,perhaps,a,"unicorn,",but,I
think,it,was,--
Yes.
Whose,is,that?
Who?
But...,how?
That's,a,Hippogriff,feather,--
I,don't,think,it,works.,,,,,,,I,think
it's,defective.
"Oh,",come,on,now.,It's,just,a
broom.
The,fastest,broom,in,the,world.
