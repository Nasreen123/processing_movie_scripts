Professor,Dumbledore.
"Yes,",Professor.,I,suppose,I,--,I
just,had,to,see,for,"myself,",if...
...,the,rumors,were,true.
About,the,school,as,well?,They
wouldn't,really,close,"Hogwarts,"
would,"they,",Professor?
Sir?,If,it,all,stopped.,If,the
person,responsible,was,caught...
"No,",sir.,Nothing.
Dumbledore,studies,Riddle,for,a,moment.
"Evening,",Hagrid.
Hagrid,SLAMS,the,door,shut.
I'm,going,to,have,to,turn,you,"in,"
Hagrid.,I,don't,think,you,meant
it,to,kill,anyone,--
Hagrid.,The,dead,girl's,parents
will,be,here,tomorrow.,The,least
Hogwarts,can,do,is,make,sure,the
thing,that,killed,their,daughter
is,slaughtered.
She,won't,wake.
She's,still,alive.,But,only,just.
A,memory.,Preserved,in,a,diary
for,fifty,years.
It,won't,come,until,it's,called.
You,won't,be,needing,it.
I'm,afraid,I,can't,do,"that,",Harry.
You,"see,",as,poor,Ginny,grows
weaker...,I,grow,stronger.
Yes.,I'm,afraid,so.,But,"then,"
she's,been,in,so,much,"pain,",poor
Ginny.,She's,been,writing,to,me
for,"months,",telling,me,all,her
pitiful,worries,and,woes.,Ginny
poured,her,soul,out,to,me.,I,grew
stronger,on,a,diet,of,her,deepest
"fears,",her,darkest,secrets.,I
grew,powerful,enough,to,start
feeding,Ginny,a,few,"secrets,",to
start,pouring,a,bit,of,my,soul
back,into,her...
"Yes,","Harry,",it,was,Ginny,Weasley
who,opened,the,Chamber,of,Secrets.
It,was,Ginny,who,set,the,Basilisk
on,the,Mudbloods,and,the,Squib's
cat.,Ginny,who,wrote,threatening
messages,on,the,walls.
Because,I,told,her,to.,You'll
find,that,I,can,be,very
persuasive.,Not,that,she,knew
what,she,was,doing.,She,"was,"
shall,we,"say,",in,a,kind,of,trance.
"Still,",the,power,of,the,diary
began,to,scare,her,and,she,tried
to,dispose,of,it,in,the,girls'
bathroom.,But,"then,",who,should
find,it...,but,you.,The,very
person,I,was,most,anxious,to,meet.
Ginny,told,me,all,about,you.,I
knew,I,had,to,talk,to,"you,",meet
you,if,I,could.,So,I,decided,to
show,you,my,capture,of,that
brainless,"oaf,","Hagrid,",to,gain
your,trust.
It,was,my,word,against,Hagrid's.
Only,Dumbledore,seemed,to,think
Hagrid,was,innocent.
I,knew,it,wouldn't,be,safe,to,open
the,Chamber,again,while,I,was
still,at,school.,So,I,decided,to
leave,behind,a,"diary,",preserving
my,sixteen-year-old,self,in,its
"pages,",so,that,one,day...,I,would
be,able,to,lead,another,to,finish
Salazar,Slytherin's,noble,work.
Haven't,I,told,"you,",that,killing
Mudbloods,doesn't,matter,to,me
anymore?,For,many,months,"now,",my
new,target,has,been...,you.
Imagine,my,disappointment,when,I
learned,Ginny,had,stolen,the,diary
back,from,you.
She,was,afraid.,Afraid,you'd
learn,how,to,work,the,diary.
Afraid,I'd,tell,you,just,who,it
was,that,had,been,strangling,all
those,roosters.
Come,"now,",Harry.,Don't,look,so
disappointed.,Had,Ginny,succeeded
in,destroying,the,"diary,",she,would
have,destroyed,me.,And,we
couldn't,be,having,this,little
talk.,And,I,have,so,many
questions,for,you.
"Well,",how,is,it,that,a,baby,with
no,extraordinary,magical,talent
managed,to,defeat,the,greatest
wizard,of,all,time?,How,did,you
escape,with,nothing,but,a,"scar,"
while,Lord,Voldemort's,powers,were
destroyed?
Voldemort,is,my,"past,",present,and
future.
Surely,you,didn't,think,I,would
keep,my,filthy,Muggle,father's
name?
"No,",I,fashioned,myself,a,new,"name,"
a,name,I,knew,wizards,everywhere
would,one,day,fear,to,"speak,",when
I,became,the,greatest,sorcerer,in
the,world.
Dumbledore's,been,driven,out,of
this,castle,by,the,mere,memory,of
me.
This,is,what,Dumbledore,sends,his
defender!,A,songbird,and,an,old
hat!
Speak,to,"me,",Slytherin.
Let's,match,the,powers,of,Lord
"Voldemort,",Heir,of,Salazar
"Slytherin,",against,the,famous
Harry,"Potter,",shall,we?
Kill,him!
Parseltongue,won't,save,you,"now,"
Potter.,The,Basilisk,only,obeys,me.
Fool!,Think,you're,safe!,,,It,can
still,hear,you!
"Yes,",Potter.,The,process,is
nearly,complete.,In,a,few
"minutes,",Ginny,Weasley,will,be
dead.,And,I,will,cease,to,be,a
memory.,Lord,Voldemort,will
return.,Very,much...,alive.
"Remarkable,",isn't,it?,How,quickly
the,venom,of,the,Basilisk
penetrates,the,body?,If,you,have
any,final,"words,","Potter,",you'd
best,speak,them,now.,I'd,guess
you,have,little,more,than,a,minute
to,live.
So,ends,the,famous,Harry,Potter.
On,his,knees,in,the,Chamber,of
Secrets.,Defeated,at,last,by,the
Dark,Lord,he,so,unwisely
challenged.,You'll,be,back,with
your,dear,Mudblood,mother,"soon,"
Harry...
What,are,you,doing?,No.,,,,,Stop...
No!
